      I came into the world and looked at it, and it was a moment I could not remember anything about. But it was the beginning of my happiness and suffering.

I started school when I was about 7 years old. I remember it was an eye-opening experience for me. I met friends after having to be alone with my toys and bamboo. At that time, I thought I was very happy. There was just me and my toys, and the whole world was filled with happiness.

      I began to develop an interest in programming, and that was when I first learned about the concept of "self-learning." I started writing small programs for my games, and then I began to delve deeper into the field of programming and fell in love with it. In the same year, I began to read about and meet many inventors, and Nikola Tesla became my idol. He was a brilliant electrical engineer to me.

      It was time for me to decide on my educational path. I was interested in space and energy. At the time, there was a course on renewable energy, and I thought it was very interesting. This was a rather difficult decision, as I had to live with it for four years.          </div>
